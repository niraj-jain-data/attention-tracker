      <div class="title">Bipasha Basu had to seduce John Abraham so I told her to decide how far she would want to go: Pooja Bhatt on directing the intimate scene in ‘Jism’</div>
      <div class="excerpt">
        In a recent interview, filmmaker Pooja Bhatt spoke about directing the 2003 film <em>Jism</em> and guiding lead actress Bipasha Basu through intimate scenes. She emphasized that she allowed Bipasha to set her comfort level for the seduction scenes with John Abraham.  
        <br><br>
        Pooja explained, “I hand-picked the crew so that Bipasha felt safe and supported. I told her as an actress and a woman, I won’t ask her to do anything she is uncomfortable with.”  
        <br><br>
        The film, while bold for its time, focused on portraying sensuality without nudity. Pooja noted that her role was to ensure authenticity while respecting the actor’s boundaries, allowing Bipasha to make her own decisions during the intimate scenes.  
        <br><br>
        This approach highlighted the importance of consent and comfort on film sets, making the experience professional yet empowering for the actors involved.
